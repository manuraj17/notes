          I am stuck with a problem. The kind of problem that I have no clue how to analyze. It is more of a situation; Or a state of mind. Though, it is a problem. It's only and mine and nobody else's. It is more like sinking in a quicksand, when I know I am  being sucked into it and I absolutely make no effort to escape it. There is no fear of what is going to happen next. I am there, just, getting sucked into and no reaction at all. Though I fail to quantiy as of how much am sunken into it but it is happening. Right now I can picture it as if am in the middle of nowhere in a quicksand with absolutely nothing to help myself get out of it. Moreoever, there is no effort from my side to get out as well. This is a really bad situation. It is like one of those black and white pictures you imagine with a backdrop of pure silence, absolutely no sound. There is no life in it. This, is actually death. Devour of any positiveness, any ambition, any need - death. There is no purpose of existence. At that point the person is no more. From a well laid pathway to midst of a vast barren land which seems the same in all 360 degrees. Going anywhere would be the same and it doesn't matter at all. This should be happening. This is another bad version of the monotonous life where you atleast want to carry out the 'monotonous' tasks, here I do not even want to do that. Thus the quicksand middle of nowhere. I am being pulled into some sort of deep bad state of mind and not knowing what to do or what I want to do. All the positiveness, ambition, aim etc have been sucked out. Just a dead mind. I do not know how to snap out of it. I am out of motivation to get myself to atleast think what I want to do though I have been doing this to myself for past couple of years, everyday. I think my mind has run out of zen or energy. It just can't do it anymore. It died out of exhaustion. I feel like a robot. Idiot. You throw something at me I do it. I am unable to think of myself of what I want to do that I would love to do. That is what a computer, a robot is. It is void of any thinking ability but superb at tasks which we throw at it. Thing is we gotta throw something at it, given it is 'programmed' to do that task. Coffee maker is not going to sense you are awake and make coffee for you. (Maybe a bad example). There is a lot of 'I' in this writing. This is about me right now and you may be calling it selfish but I think it is different. This is more like expressing my illness to a doctor where it is more about me. Wondering am whining? I don't know, am just, saying. In a day's time Monday would come and for next 5 days I would be counting every hour for the day that I eagerly wait. For what? I can't think. This is going to repeate, for months. Time is going to fly. It does all the time. I absolutely have no aim. Middle of nowhere, in a quicksand staring at nothingness. I feel like I have always been a trained pet dog, taught to obey commands. I have always been shown a target to chase or a target to catch. I am set free one day and I do not knwo what to do of it. I need someone to command me. I can't think, I am a robot. That's what I am. I am a dead person now. Devoid of pinnacle of human characherisitcs - creativity and thought. I am waiting for a command, to start running again. Maybe a rop to get out of the quicksand and a signboard then to say which way I should run. This is not a hope, more of a guess that's what I need. Till then, I believe I will be here getting sucked.
